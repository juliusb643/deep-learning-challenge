The purpose of this analysis is to show the neural network models that will most accurately predict success. 

For data preprocessing, the target variable is "is_successful", and the feature variables include "income_amt", "ask_amt" and "status". The variables that could be removed from the data input include "Use_Case" and "Organization".

I used two hidden layers and an output layer. As far as neurons and epochs and activation functions, I adjusted these as I went to try to achieve my target model performance. I was only able to get up to 74% accuracy and missed the 75% threshold. I adjusted the number of deleted categories, and I changed the thresholds to account for more information.
